To test APIs with Swagger:

Use the login endpoint and send a request with: 


username: hrmanager1@gmail.com
 
password: hrmanager 


or create your own account with a register request. Then use the token from the login response to authorize.


Also in appsettings.json, change the DefaultConnections string according to your PosgreSQL credentials
